git-backup is a utility to backup all Git entities that were not pushed to a remote as Git patches and store them to the specified place.
These are:
* non-staged modifications;
* staged modifications;
* untracked files (if the option is given);
* non-pushed commits on all local branches that track remote branches;
* commits on all local non-tracking branches, that are not contained in any tracking branch (current they are compared only with master);
* all stashes.
