This script is for backing up all Git entities that were not pushed to a remote.
That is:
* non-staged modifications
* untracked files
* staged modifications
* non-pushed commits on all local branches that track remote branches
* commits on all local non-tracking branches, that are not contained in any tracking branch
* all stashes
