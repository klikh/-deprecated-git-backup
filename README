These are:
* non-staged modifications;
* staged modifications;
* untracked files (if the option is given);
* non-pushed commits on all local branches that track remote branches;
* commits on all local non-tracking branches, that are not contained in any tracking branch (current they are compared only with master);
* all stashes.

REQUIREMENTS:
* Ruby. Tested only under 1.9.3. Don't know if it works on 1.8.7 or other versions.
* Git. And it must be in the PATH.
* RubyGem trollop
* zip native utility, and it also should be in the PATH. You don't need this if you don't wanna use "--zip".
